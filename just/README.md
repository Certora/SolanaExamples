# Just modules

This directory contains several modules for the [just command runner][just]. They simplify running the Certora Solana Prover. 

These are optional, but are highly recommended.

They require `just`, that can be installed via:

```sh
cargo install just
```

More details on `just` can be found on its [home page][just].
